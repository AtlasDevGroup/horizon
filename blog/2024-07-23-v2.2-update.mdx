### :sparkles:  Automations 2.1
We’ve made a major leap in automation efficiency! Horizon now skips guilds with no enabled automations, boosting performance by +50%. Additionally, automations are now lightning-fast and can post articles even when descriptions are missing. Say goodbye to delays!


### :rocket: Permissions Manager
Useful note for everyone, you can use Discord’s built-in system to block certain roles from accessing specific commands. This can help you streamline command permissions and improve server management. Horizon also offers it's own Permissions Manager for permissions in case you need it!

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Fixed the deletion data process bug—old data has been thoroughly cleared.
- Redesigned the server settings editor and preferences interface for a more nicer selection process, moving away from traditional buttons.
- Updated reports automations to avoid using a static image for each post, providing more dynamic content.
- Resolved the bug that made rover commands visible only to authors, so now everyone can access them as intended.
