Hello everyone! As 2024 comes to a close, letâ€™s take a moment to see what Horizon has accomplished this year. Itâ€™s been an exciting journey, and we couldnâ€™t have done it without all of you! <!-- truncate -->Donâ€™t forget, Horizonâ€™s birthday is on January 4th, just around the cornerâ€”time to celebrate!

### :tada:  8,000+ Commands executed!
This is an incredible achievement! A big thank you to everyone who used Horizon this year. Every command run helped make this milestone possible!

### ðŸ“ˆ  58,000+ Automations posted!
From daily APODs to articles, launches, and events, Horizon has kept you informed and connected. Now, fewer users miss out on these important astronomical events. Weâ€™re proud to keep you up to date with the latest!

### :loudspeaker: 93,000+ Total users!
Thatâ€™s right, a whole galaxy of users from all guilds! Many of you have run at least one command, helping Horizon grow and improve. Your support has been amazing!

Itâ€™s been a year of liftoff, and weâ€™re excited to continue this journey with all of you. The next year promises even more, with our REWRITE update coming soon! ðŸš€
