Hello everyone, as 2024 comes to a close, let's take a look at what Horizon has achieved this year. <!-- truncate --> And donâ€™t forget, Horizon birthday is coming up on **January 4th**, just around the corner!

### **:tada:  8,000+ Commands executed!** 
Thatâ€™s a lot of activity this year, thanks to all of you! You all made this possible!

### **ðŸ“ˆ  58,000+ Automations posted!** 
From daily APODs to articles, launches, and events, Horizon has been keeping you in the loop! Now, fewer users miss these important moments.

### **:loudspeaker: 93,000+ Total users!** 
A whole galaxy of users from all guilds together! Many of you have at least run one command!

Itâ€™s been a year of liftoff, and the next one promises a whole new adventure with our **REWRITE** update coming soon! :rocket:  
Thanks for being part of this journey, hereâ€™s to many more milestones ahead!
