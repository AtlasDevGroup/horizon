## :clipboard: HORIZON UPDATE V2.1-COSMOS â€¢ 01/07/24 :tada:

Hello everyone, hope you're all having a great time! Here are some small improvements and quality-of-life changes for the v2.1 update:

### :sparkles: Automations 2.0
Horizon now utilizes the latest version of the Horizon API for blogs, articles, reports, and APODs, resulting in even faster post deliveries directly to your server.

Please note that this enhancement does not apply to upcoming launches and events, but we have also improved the posting times and the queue management, and we will continue to monitor automations performance.

### :sparkles:  Horizon Tips
You may now receive helpful tips during Horizon commands, guiding you to our documentation or suggesting actions for better utilizing Horizon. These are not ads, but genuine tips. You can also disable them permanently at any time.

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Fixed issue with astronaut data, ensuring more than 7 astronauts are displayed on the ISS.
- Resolved the "Unknown interactions" error permanently for all Rover Images.
- Horizon now schedules fewer tasks as Horizon API takes over management.
- Redesigned some button interfaces for a more minimalistic and user-friendly design.
