Today, Horizon by Atlas Team is proudly included in The Space Devs representation at the **International Astronautical Congress (IAC) 2024** in Milan, Italy!

This big event brings together over 8,000 experts from different industries, research, and institutions to discuss how space can help make the world more sustainable. The theme this year, “Responsible Space for Sustainability,” focuses on protecting space for future generations through peaceful and cooperative use.

We’re very excited to be part of The Space Devs' representation. We rely on their powerful API to improve our astronomy services, and we’re proud to use the amazing data they provide. Their API helps us deliver accurate and up-to-date space data for space enthusiasts directly on your Discord server without external tracking websites, all in one place, to your chats.

Read their full public representation [here](https://github.com/TheSpaceDevs/public-outreach/blob/main/documents/iac_2024_manuscript.pdf) and of course show them some love.
