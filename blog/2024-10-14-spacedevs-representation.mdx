<!-- truncate -->

This big event will bring together over 8,000 people from different fields, including space experts, researchers, and organizations, to talk about how space can help create a better and more sustainable world.

### What is the International Astronautical Congress (IAC)?

The IAC is an annual meeting where people from around the world gather to share ideas and discoveries in space exploration. This year’s theme is “**Responsible Space for Sustainability**.” This means finding ways to protect space for future generations while using it peacefully and cooperatively.

Italy will host IAC 2024, as this event is taking place 60 years after the launch of the first Italian satellite, San Marco. It’s a great opportunity to celebrate Italy’s role in space and encourage everyone to work together for a sustainable future.

### Who Are [The Space Devs](https://thespacedevs.com/)?

**The Space Devs** is a group of developers who love space and work hard to make space information easy to access. They have a powerful API that we at Horizon use to provide the latest astronomy data directly to your Discord server. This means you can get all the information you need in one place without needing to visit other websites.

The Space Devs aim to connect space app developers and offer helpful data and tools for free. We’re proud to be part of this community and excited to use their amazing data to improve our services.

### Thank You!
