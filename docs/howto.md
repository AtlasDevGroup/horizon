## How Horizon works?

Horizon is hosted on Atlas Servers, managed by a dedicated team of friends and developers. It uses the Horizon API, an exclusive private API by Atlas Developers connected to a Mongo Database.

The Horizon API aggregates data from 6 different API providers, efficiently managing rate limits and updating the database with new data every few minutes.

Horizon then checks the database for new data and delivers it through commands and automations to all servers with these features enabled. This makes Horizon one of the best choices for up-to-date astronomy and space event information for your Discord Server!


**UP-TO-DATE DATA TO HORIZON:**
```
API Providers => Horizon API (FETCH) => Horizon API Database (SAVE) =>
Horizon APP (GET) => Horizon APP Datasbe (SAVE) => Automations (SEND) && Commands Data (UPDATE)
```
