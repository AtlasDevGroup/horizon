# Horizon Badges

Welcome to the Horizon Badges hub—a fun and exciting way to recognize and reward the amazing servers that use our bot. Show off your server's achievements and affiliations with these cool badges!

## What Are Horizon Badges?

Horizon Badges are here to recognize and reward servers that use our bot. These badges not only show your support for Horizon but also indicate whether a server is partnered with Atlas or subscribed to Horizon Plus. It's like earning scout badges, but for your awesome Discord server! By displaying these badges, your server can proudly show its involvement and contributions within the Horizon community.

## How Can I Get Them?

Eager to earn some shiny badges? Here's how you can start collecting them and make your server stand out:

### Gold Badges

- **Verified Badge:** Awarded to servers that are part of the Atlas Team, the brilliant minds behind Horizon. This badge means your server is directly involved with Horizon's development. Not many servers have this, making it super special.
  
- **Partner Badge:** For servers in the Atlas Partnership Program. Partners use Horizon for free and enjoy Plus features along with special perks. It's a symbol of collaboration between your server and the Atlas Team.

- **Tester Badge:** Given to servers that allow early access to beta commands. This badge is tied to the server owner's account and is available to all their servers. Being a beta tester means you're helping shape the future of Horizon.

### Silver Badges

- **Plus+ Badge:** Awarded to servers that subscribe to Horizon Plus. This monthly subscription supports Horizon's development and unlocks extra features for your server.

- **Automations Badge:** For servers that love staying up-to-date with automations. Earn this badge by enabling at least one automation using the `/automations` and `/settings` commands. This shows your server is making the most of Horizon's features.

- **Feedbacker Badge:** Given to servers that submitted feedback during the first public feedback submission. This badge is also tied to the server owner's account and is available to all their servers. Your feedback helps us improve Horizon.

### Bronze Badges

- **Early Badge:** Granted to the first 200 servers that invited Horizon. It's a limited-edition badge and will not be available after the 200-server limit is reached. Having this badge means your server was one of the early supporters of Horizon.

- **Member Badge:** Awarded to any server that invites Horizon. It's a basic yet lovely badge that shows your involvement with Horizon. Members can use the bot and enjoy all its features.

## Reviewing Your Badges

**Want to see all the badges your server has earned? It's easy!** Just head over to your Server Settings by using the `/settings` command. Here, you can review all your badges and see what you've achieved so far. Display them with pride and let your community know about your server's milestones.

## Show Off Your Badges

**Earned some badges? Awesome!** Show them off with pride. These badges are more than just icons—they're a testament to your server's dedication, support, and contributions to Horizon. Display them prominently on your server and let your community know about the hard work and involvement that earned these badges.
