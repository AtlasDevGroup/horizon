# Configuration

Discover how to efficiently configure Horizon's automations and access command information through Horizon Settings. Let's make your server shine like the night sky!

## What's Settings?

The settings command is crucial for customizing Horizon's behavior on your server. It's a command you'll probably use a lot. To get started, simply run the command `/settings` in any channel, if you have the permissions. Don't worryâ€”only you can see this message.

Use the select menu below to choose the category you wish to edit. You can always navigate back using the `Go Back` buttons.

:::info
The `/automations` command utilizes device recognition. For more information, refer to our privacy policy. You can disable this feature using the `/preferences` command if desired, but it's not recommended.

## How to Customize Enabled Automations?

Customizing enabled automations is straightforward using the Horizon interface directly on Discord. Use the command `/settings` and navigate to the automation you wish to edit using the select menu. When you modify a setting, Horizon automatically saves the changes instantly.

:::tip
Buttons and colors of automations can be edited in the Server Settings using the same command. Changes made here will affect all enabled automations in the specific server. To adjust button behavior and customize automation embeds, select the `Server Settings` menu from the `/settings` command.
