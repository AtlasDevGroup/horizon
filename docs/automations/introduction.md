# Introduction

### Why Automations? What's this?
**The answer we give is simple:** to inspire dreams, to help people appreciate themselves, and to remind us how small we are in the vast universe. To live each day as something unique, knowing that not all planets have life. Some people will never die since they never get the chance to be born.

Automations are the feature we are most proud of because they allow you to learn everything humanity has achieved in our solar system and beyond. They showcase our intelligence and the relentless human spirit striving to understand our existence.

### How to enable Automations?
All servers that have invited Horizon can enable automations. We offer five different automations:

- Articles: Announces all the newest news.
- Blogs: Travel through the universe with engaging blogs.
- Reports: Get the latest ISS reports from the astronauts' orbiting home.
- Next Launches: Stay informed about upcoming space launches.
- Next Events: Learn about significant space events visible to everyone.

Server administrators can enable these options using the command `/automations` and customize them using the command `/settings`. For more helpful guides, use the command `/help` and select the corresponding command.

### Are Automations in BETA?
**Yes, automations are still in BETA, and as a feature that we are most proud of, we make frequent improvements.**

While we strive for perfection, please note that system failures may occur, or articles with incorrect information or placeholders may appear. If this happens, please report it to us with the message ID and guild ID where the error occurred. Again, it may never happen, but we have to inform you!
