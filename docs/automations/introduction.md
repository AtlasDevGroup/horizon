# Introduction
Learn how Automations in Horizon streamline notifications and explore the basics of Horizon's API for integration and enhanced functionality.

### Why Automations? What's this?
**The answer we give is simple:** to inspire dreams, to help people appreciate themselves, and to remind us how small we are in the vast universe. To live each day as something unique, knowing that not all planets have life. Some people will never die since they never get the chance to be born.

Automations are the feature we are most proud of because they allow you to learn everything humanity has achieved in our solar system and beyond. They showcase our intelligence and the relentless human spirit striving to understand our existence.

### How to enable Automations?
Enabling any automation is straightforward. Use the command `/automations` and select the function you wish to enable with the `Enable Function` option. You can include the optional `channel` value for specific channel activation.

We offer five different automations:
- Articles: Announces all the newest news.
- Blogs: Travel through the universe with engaging blogs.
- Reports: Get the latest ISS reports from the astronauts' orbiting home.
- Next Launches: Stay informed about upcoming space launches.
- Next Events: Learn about significant space events visible to everyone.

### How to disable Automations?
Disabling an automation follows a similar process. Use the command `/automations` and select the function you want to disable with the `Disable Function` option. The `channel` option is not required and can be ignored. Additionally, automations can also be disabled using the `/settings` command and navigating to the selected automation.
